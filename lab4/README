Testing Protocols:

To test the act script and the dataflow model, enter the part1 folder and run part1_test.sh. This will run the actscript needed to test the accumulator.

Content:

Dataflow model is contained in part1 and tested using an chp program.

The interact script is located in part2 with all of the output files. It also contains the cells.act file.

All layouts are built in part3 folder in the mag sub_directory. Some layouts can be tested in the sims sub_directory although some layouts like TIELO don't function properly in irsim. Some of the bigger layouts also seem to crash when attempting to convert to a sim.
